How to Auto Generate Documentation:

Install Sphinx in your IDE

pip install sphinx

Ideally it is already set up in the current way it is and you should not need to change any files

If it is not set up then run sphinx-quickstart in your IDE or in your anaconda terminal

Accept all default information

Once this is set up you need to change two files

conf.py needs to have the line
extensions = []
replaced with
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

I think its possible for there to be other elements in the extensions array, if there are and autodoc isn't there
then just add autodoc

Go into index.rst

Next change the following bit:
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

To:
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   modules

You'll notice that modules were added to this

This is what I was able to do to change everything

After this you should be ready to generate the documentation

First you need to type build clean in your anaconda prompt in this docs directory

That's just to make sure old files are deleted

After doing this then you need to run make html

This generates the HTML documents

Beware - it has strange functionality with our executable scripts, changing it to only look at helper classes right now

I changed it to read only from the helper functions, adding in themes now...

pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

Changed line in conf.py from
html_theme = 'alabaster'
to
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'

SIGNIFICANTLY better, now its pretty!

Made a change in modules.rst, removed the executables from the list because they produced the error:
WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document

They must have been left over from when it was autogenerated

IMPORTANT

Previously there was an issue where it was not working with PerformAnalysis

It was saying it couldn't find the helpers module as it was already inside the directory

Fix for this:
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../helpers'))
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('..'))

Add the final line in the statement above in that position

This allows the path to now exist to the helpers folder

How to run once set up:

make clean
* This is used to remove any html files

make html
* This is used to automatically generate any and all html files

Note:
Sometimes it will throw an error saying that there is not _static folder or no_templates folder
This seems to not affect the program, but you can remove the error by manually putting these folders at the same
level as your rst files and _build folder.
Just make an empty folder with the name _static and another with the name _templates and it removed warnings for me
